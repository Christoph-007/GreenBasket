## 🚀 How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to get the backend server running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (Local or Atlas URL)
- **Cloudinary Account** (for images)
- **Gmail Account** (for emails - app password required)
- **Razorpay Account** (for payments)

### 2. Installation
Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` root directory (copy `.env.example`).
Fill in the credentials:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/greenbasket
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Cloudinary (Images)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...

# Razorpay (Payments)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=...
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...

# Email (Notifications)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

### 4. Start Server
**For Development (Auto-restart on save):**
```bash
npm run dev
```
**For Production:**
```bash
npm start
```
The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.
